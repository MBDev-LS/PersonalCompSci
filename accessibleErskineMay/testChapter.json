By about the same period, the Lords and Commons began to deliberate separately. The King, Lords and Commons would meet together initially; afterwards the Lords and Commons would deliberate in separate rooms; and finally the Commons or their spokesmen would rejoin the King and the Lords.</p><p >By the thirteenth century Westminster was the centre of English royal government and the Palace of Westminster the habitual meeting place of the English Parliament. From at least the mid-fourteenth century onwards, the Lords and Commons usually met for the opening of Parliament in the Painted Chamber, and after hearing the cause of summons were ordered to meet separately for deliberation. The Lords would withdraw to a room known as the White Chamber at the south-east corner of the old palace, where they continued to meet until the early nineteenth century, while the Commons would deliberate in either the Painted Chamber or the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. After 1394 they often used the Abbey's refectory. They did not acquire a permanent meeting place until after 1547, when they were granted the use of St Stephen's Chapel within the Palace.<a id=\"footnote-link-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-item-1\">1</a></p><p >There were spokesmen for the Commons from the mid-thirteenth century, though it is not known whether they also presided over the meetings of the Commons. Traditionally the first Speaker was Sir Peter de la Mare in 1376, though the first to be recorded on the Parliament Rolls is his successor, Sir Thomas Hungerford.<a id=\"footnote-link-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-item-2\">2</a>  The first reference to a Clerk is to Robert de Melton in 1363.<a id=\"footnote-link-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-item-3\">3</a></p><p >The term \u2018Member of Parliament\u2019 was originally taken to refer to members of either House. Since the Restoration of 1660, however, it has usually referred to Members of the Commons only.<a id=\"footnote-link-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-item-4\">4</a>  The Parliamentary and Municipal Elections Act 1872 ended the use in the returns of the very old terms of knights (for county constituencies), citizens or burgesses (who sat for cities and boroughs), barons of the Cinque Ports, and burgesses of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; and these distinctions ceased to figure in general use.

Parliaments\u2014originally called <em>colloquia</em> \u2014emerged (as they did in England) in the middle of the thirteenth century, as more formal legal and judicial meetings of the King's council, attended by the various ranks of nobility. Other Estates of the community of the realm were added as time went on. The first Estate (bishops and abbots) were among the earliest members of Parliament. The abbots ceased to sit after the Reformation. The membership of the bishops was interrupted during the civil wars of the seventeenth century. They returned at the Restoration, only to be removed finally on the re-establishment of presbytery at the Revolution of 1688\u201389.</p><p >Not long after the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century, representatives of the royal burghs began to attend, initially only when taxation was demanded.

By these successive additions the number of the Commons was increased to 658; and notwithstanding the changes effected in the distribution of the elective franchise by the Reform Acts in 1832, that number continued unaltered, except by the disenfranchisement of certain cities and boroughs for corruption, until the year 1885, when the number of the House was raised to 670 by the operation of the Redistribution of Seats Act of that year. By the Representation of the People Act 1918 the number of Members was increased to 707, but the reduction of the number of Members for constituencies in Northern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and the cessation of representation of constituencies in the rest of Ireland consequential on the establishment of the Irish Free State, reduced the number of Members of the House of Commons to 615.</p><p >As a result of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944, which made temporary provision for the subdivision of certain abnormally large constituencies (specified in the second schedule to the Act),<a id=\"footnote-link-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-item-1\">1</a>  the number of Members was increased by 25 to 640.
