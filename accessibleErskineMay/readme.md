# Accessible Erskin May

A [digital version](https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/) of Erskin May, the document that sets out the procedure of the UK Parliament and the consitutional conventions affecting it, can be found on the UK Parliament website.

This is fantastic, and - even better - the website is built to be accessible to as many people as possible (for more info see [here](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/accessibility/)). However, it can be difficult for some, including dyslexics, to read long passages of texts, such as those contained in Erskin May, on a screen.

Helpfully, however, the UK Parliament also [provides an API](https://erskinemay-api.parliament.uk/index.html) which provides programmatic access to the document. Using this API, this quick project will compile the many sections of Erskin May into a plain, accessible PDF document, so that this document can be printed for personal use.
